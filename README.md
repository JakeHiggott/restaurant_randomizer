# restaurant_randomizer
NOTE 1: I fixed the issue where we had two separate code bases on one and the gradle error problems. You should be able to clone the codebase and run the app right away in android studio. Good luck working on it guys. MS teams me if you have any questions or need any help!


Note 2: If you are going to help with the project I have closed the development-1.0 branch for good. Please make branches off of the new development-1.1 I have made and submit pull requests to that branch
if you have any trouble with that or are new to git MSteams me (Jake) individually or in the group chat and I can setup a call and show you how to make changes.
