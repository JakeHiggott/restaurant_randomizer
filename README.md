# restaurant_randomizer
NOTE: This Repo has 2 separate apps in it (bad I know) when you clone it clone it please clone it via the command line then open the "restuarant randomizer app"  in your android studio. This is a file inside the repo. I would advise making your changes and committing/ pushing them via the command line as doing it inside of android studio is possible but sketchy. 
Anyway! Good luck working on it guys. MS teams me if you have any questions or need any help!
